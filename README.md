# mp3 manager "Project Wurlitzer"
A DotNetCore Winform app used to catalogue and edit the MP3 collection in your Music folders.

This app's delivers these features
1. A way to catalogue all the MP3s the user has on their drive.
2. The ability to update - mass or individually - sets of songs. Imagine you've ripped a CD (hello 2002) and the metadata isn't included. This will have the ability to update or create MP3 tags.
3. A way to find duplicates. Over the years, files get copied, converted and duplicated all over the place. This will help in detecting duplicates.
4. A built-in webserver that launches a browser and makes the library playable via JSON and an embedded HTML5 Audio widget.

Ultimately, the app will be able to generate a JSON or XML playlist and include tags based on what the USER (not the vendors) prefer. e.g. "high energy", "sad", "never play"
Other someday feature might be an API call to Discogs to retrieve album art.
